I marked this one as Irrelevant since the site came up as an ad to trade in your cell phone. Not certain if that should have been a Page Load error, though, since the page loaded had nothing to do with dog adoptions or dogs. Could you clarify the difference between Irrelevant and Page Load error a bit more?
