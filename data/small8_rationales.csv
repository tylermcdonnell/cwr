Waterboarding
Waterboarding, a torture method that simulates drowning, has existed in various forms since the time of the Spanish Inquisition. Generally, water is poured over the face of an immobilized prisoner, inducing the gag reflex and mimicking sensations associated with drowning.

Baby jaundice

Jaundice in newborn babies is not too uncommon. About 20% of newborns suffer from jaundice. Jaundice is the yellowish staining of the skin and eyes that is caused by high levels in blood of the chemical bilirubin.The color of the skin and eyes vary depending on the level of bilirubin. It may take about a week for the liver to break the bilirubin that may be in excess in some newborn babies. Don't worry - your baby will suffer no pain or discomfort as a result of having jaundice",0,,

Newborn babies have additional red blood cells reserved for the birth process. One of the breakdown products of red blood cells is bilirubin. The liver in the newborn is fully developed, but not 100 percent efficient. Extra bilirubin is transferred to the blood and stored in the skin until the liver breaks it down.This is called physiological jaundice in newborns.",3,,

Bilirubin is produced when your body breaks down red blood cells. Normally, the liver processes bilirubin and then your body eliminates it in your stool.

When the liver cannot process bilirubin properly, the excess builds up and causes the signature yellowing of the skin and eyes. Any condition or health issue that causes this yellow skin is considered a jaundice-associated condition.

Jaundice is common in newborns, especially those who are premature. It does not always require treatment.",2,,

Phase one

    Term infants - jaundice lasts for about 10 days with a rapid rise of serum bilirubin up to 204 μmol/l (12 mg/dL).
    Preterm infants - jaundice lasts for about two weeks, with a rapid rise of serum bilirubin up to 255 μmol/l (15 mg/dL).

Phase two - bilirubin levels decline to about 34 μmol/l (2 mg/dL) for two weeks, eventually mimicking adult values.
